[//]: # (title: Compose compiler)

The Compose compiler is supplemented by a Gradle plugin, which simplifies setup and offers
easier access to compiler options.
When applied with the Android Gradle plugin (AGP), this Compose compiler plugin will override the coordinates
of the Compose compiler supplied automatically by AGP.

The Compose compiler has been merged into the Kotlin repository since Kotlin 2.0.0.
This helps smooth the migration of your projects to Kotlin 2.0.0 and later, as the Compose compiler ships
simultaneously with Kotlin and will always be compatible with Kotlin of the same version.

> It is strongly recommended that you update your multiplatform Compose app created with Kotlin 2.0.0 to version 2.0.10 or later. The Compose
> compiler 2.0.0 has an issue where it sometimes incorrectly infers the stability of types in multiplatform projects with
> non-JVM targets, which can lead to unnecessary (or even endless) recompositions.
>
> If your app is built with Compose compiler 2.0.10 or later but uses dependencies built with Compose compiler 2.0.0,
> these older dependencies may still cause recomposition issues.
> To prevent this, update your dependencies to versions built with the same Compose compiler as your app.

To use the new Compose compiler plugin in your project, apply it for each module that uses Compose.
See the migration instructions below:

* [Migrating a Compose Multiplatform project](#migrating-a-compose-multiplatform-project)
* [Migrating a Jetpack Compose project](#migrating-a-jetpack-compose-project)
* [Compose Compiler options DSL](#compose-compiler-options-dsl)

## Migrating a Compose Multiplatform project

Starting with Compose Multiplatform 1.6.10, you should apply the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose` Gradle plugin to each
module that uses the `org.jetbrains.compose` plugin:

1. Add the Compose compiler Gradle plugin to the [Gradle version catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:conventional-dependencies-toml):

    ```
    [versions]
    # ...
    kotlin = "%kotlinVersion%"
    
    [plugins]
    # ...
    jetbrainsCompose = { id = "org.jetbrains.compose", version.ref = "compose-plugin" }
    kotlinMultiplatform = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.multiplatform", version.ref = "kotlin" }
    compose-compiler = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose", version.ref = "kotlin" }
    ```

2. Add the Gradle plugin to the root `build.gradle.kts` file:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        // ...
        alias(libs.plugins.jetbrainsCompose) apply false
        alias(libs.plugins.compose.compiler) apply false
    }
    ```

3. Apply the plugin to every module that uses Compose Multiplatform:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        // ...
        alias(libs.plugins.jetbrainsCompose)
        alias(libs.plugins.compose.compiler)
    }
    ```

4. If you are using compiler options for the Jetpack Compose compiler, set them in the `composeCompiler {}` block.
   See [Compose Compiler options DSL](#compose-compiler-options-dsl) for reference.

#### Possible issue: "Missing resource with path"

When switching from Kotlin 1.9.0 to 2.0.0, or from 2.0.0 to 1.9.0, you may encounter the following error:

```
org.jetbrains.compose.resources.MissingResourceException: Missing resource with path: ...
```

To resolve this, delete all of the `build` directories: at the root of your project and in each of the modules.

## Migrating a Jetpack Compose project

When migrating to Kotlin 2.0.0 or newer from 1.9, you should adjust your project configuration depending on the way you deal with
the Compose compiler now. We recommend using the Kotlin Gradle plugin and the Compose compiler Gradle plugin
to automate configuration management. 

### Managing the Compose compiler with Gradle plugins

For Android modules that don't rely on Compose Multiplatform: 

1. Add the Compose compiler Gradle plugin to the [Gradle version catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:conventional-dependencies-toml):

    ```
    [versions]
    # ...
    kotlin = "%kotlinVersion%"
    
    [plugins]
    # ...
    org-jetbrains-kotlin-android = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android", version.ref = "kotlin" }
    compose-compiler = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose", version.ref = "kotlin" }
    ```

2. Add the Gradle plugin to the root `build.gradle.kts` file:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        // ...
        alias(libs.plugins.compose.compiler) apply false
    }
    ```

3. Apply the plugin to every module that uses Jetpack Compose:

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
        // ...
        alias(libs.plugins.compose.compiler)
    }
    ```

4. If you are using compiler options for the Jetpack Compose compiler, set them in the `composeCompiler {}` block.
   See [the list of compiler options](#compose-compiler-options-dsl) for reference.

5. If you reference Compose compiler artifacts directly, you can remove these references and let the Gradle plugins
   take care of things.

### Using Compose compiler without Gradle plugins

If you are not using Gradle plugins to manage the Compose compiler, update any direct references to old Maven
artifacts in your project:

  * Change `androidx.compose.compiler:compiler` to `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compose-compiler-plugin-embeddable`
  * Change `androidx.compose.compiler:compiler-hosted` to `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-compose-compiler-plugin`

## Compose compiler options DSL

The Compose compiler Gradle plugin offers a DSL for various compiler options.
You can use it to configure the compiler in the `composeCompiler {}` block of the `build.gradle.kts` file for the module
you're applying the plugin to.

There are two kinds of options you can specify:

   * General compiler settings.
   * Feature flags that enable or disable new and experimental features, which should eventually become part of the baseline.

Here's an example configuration:

```kotlin
composeCompiler {
   includeSourceInformation = true

   featureFlags = setOf(
           ComposeFeatureFlag.StrongSkipping.disabled(),
           ComposeFeatureFlag.OptimizeNonSkippingGroups
   )
}
```

> The Gradle plugin provides defaults for several Compose compiler options that were only specified manually before.
> If you have any of them set up with `freeCompilerArgs`, for example, Gradle will report a duplicate options error.
>

### General settings

#### generateFunctionKeyMetaClasses

**Type**: `Property<Boolean>`

**Default**: `false`

If `true`, generate function key meta classes with annotations indicating the functions and their group keys.

#### includeSourceInformation

**Type**: `Property<Boolean>`

**Default**: `false` (`true` for Android)

If `true`, include source information in generated code.

Records source information that can be used for tooling to determine the source location of the corresponding composable function.
This option does not affect the presence of symbols or line information normally added by the Kotlin compiler;
it only controls source information added by the Compose compiler.

#### metricsDestination

**Type**: `DirectoryProperty`

When a directory is specified, the Compose compiler will use the directory to dump [compiler metrics](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/plugins/compose/design/compiler-metrics.md#reports-breakdown).
They can be useful for debugging and optimizing your application's runtime performance:
the metrics show which composable functions are skippable, restartable, read-only, and so on.

The [reportsDestination](#reportsdestination) option allows dumping descriptive reports as well.

For a deep dive into the compiler metrics, see this [Composable metrics blog post](https://chrisbanes.me/posts/composable-metrics/).

#### reportsDestination

**Type**: `DirectoryProperty`

When a directory is specified, the Compose compiler will use the directory to dump [compiler metrics reports](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/plugins/compose/design/compiler-metrics.md#reports-breakdown).
They can be useful for optimizing your application's runtime performance:
the reports show which composable functions are skippable, restartable, read-only, and so on.

The [metricsDestination](#metricsdestination) option allows dumping raw metrics.

For a deep dive into the compiler metrics, see this [Composable metrics blog post](https://chrisbanes.me/posts/composable-metrics/).

#### stabilityConfigurationFile

> _Deprecated_ in Kotlin 2.1.0-Beta1 in favor of [stabilityConfigurationFiles](#stabilityconfigurationfiles),
> which allows using more than one stability configuration file.
> 
{style="warning"}

**Type**: `RegularFileProperty`

A stability configuration file contains a list of classes, which should be considered stable.
For details, see [Stability configuration file](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/fix#configuration-file)
in the Jetpack Compose documentation.

#### stabilityConfigurationFiles

**Type**: `ListProperty<RegularFile>`

Stability configuration files to be used for the current module.

Stability configuration files contain a list of classes that should be considered stable by the compiler.
For details, see [Stability configuration file](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/performance/stability/fix#configuration-file)
in the Jetpack Compose documentation.

Here's an example of specifying paths to several files:

```kotlin
composeCompiler {
    stabilityConfigurationFiles.addAll(
        project.layout.projectDirectory.file("configuration-file1.conf"),
        project.layout.projectDirectory.file("configuration-file2.conf"),
    )
}
```

#### includeTraceMarkers

**Type**: `Property<Boolean>`

**Default**: `true`

If `true`, include composition trace markers in the generated code.

The Compose compiler can inject additional tracing information into the bytecode, which allows it to show composable functions
in the Android Studio system trace profiler.

For details, see this [Android Developers blog post](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/jetpack-compose-composition-tracing-9ec2b3aea535).

#### targetKotlinPlatforms

**Type**: `SetProperty<KotlinPlatformType>`

Indicates Kotlin platforms to which the Compose compiler Gradle plugin should be applied.
By default, the plugin is applied to all Kotlin platforms.

To enable only one specific Kotlin platform, for example, Kotlin/JVM:

```kotlin
composeCompiler {
   targetKotlinPlatforms.set(setOf(KotlinPlatformType.jvm))
}
```

To disable the Gradle plugin for one or more Kotlin platforms, for example, Kotlin/Native and Kotlin/JS:

```kotlin
composeCompiler {
    targetKotlinPlatforms.set(
       KotlinPlatformType.values()
           .filterNot { it == KotlinPlatformType.native || it == KotlinPlatformType.js }
           .asIterable()
    )
}
```

### Feature flags

Feature flags are organized into a separate set to minimize changes to top-level properties as new flags
are continuously rolled out and deprecated.

To enable a feature flag that is disabled by default, specify it in the set, for example:

```kotlin
featureFlags = setOf(ComposeFeatureFlag.OptimizeNonSkippingGroups)
```

To disable a feature flag that is enabled by default, call the `disabled()` function on it, for example:

```kotlin
featureFlags = setOf(ComposeFeatureFlag.StrongSkipping.disabled())
```

If you are configuring the Compose compiler directly, use the following syntax to pass feature flags to it:

```none
-P plugin:androidx.compose.compiler.plugins.kotlin:featureFlag=<flag name>
```

#### IntrinsicRemember

**Default**: enabled

If enabled, turns on intrinsic remember performance optimization.

Intrinsic remember is an optimization mode that inlines `remember` invocations and, where possible, replaces `.equals()` comparisons for keys with comparisons of the `$changed` meta parameter.
This results in fewer slots being used and fewer comparisons being made at runtime.

#### OptimizeNonSkippingGroups

**Default**: disabled

If enabled, remove groups around non-skipping composable functions.

This optimization improves the runtime performance of your application by skipping
unnecessary groups around composables which do not skip (and thus do not require a group).
This optimization will remove the groups, for example, around functions explicitly marked as `@NonSkippableComposable`
and functions that are implicitly not skippable (inline functions and functions that return a non-`Unit` value such as `remember`).

> This feature is considered [Experimental](supported-platforms.md#core-kotlin-multiplatform-technology-stability-levels) and is disabled by default.
>
{style="warning"}

#### StrongSkipping

**Default**: enabled

If enabled, turns on strong skipping mode.

Strong skipping mode improves the runtime performance of your application by applying optimizations previously reserved only for stable values of composable functions whose parameters haven't changed.
For example, composables with unstable parameters become skippable, and lambdas with unstable captures are memoized.

For details, see the [description of strong skipping mode](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/plugins/compose/design/strong-skipping.md)
in the Kotlin GitHub repository.
