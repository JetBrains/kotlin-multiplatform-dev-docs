# Adaptive layouts

To provide a consistent user experience on all types of devices, adapt your app's UI to different display sizes, orientations, 
and input modes.

## Designing adaptive layouts

Follow these key guidelines when designing adaptive layouts:

* Prefer canonical layouts patterns like list-detail, feed, and supporting pane.
* Maintain consistency by reusing shared styles for padding, typography, and other design elements. Keep navigation patterns 
consistent across devices while following platform-specific guidelines.
* Break complex layouts into reusable composables for flexibility and modularity.
* Adjust for screen density and orientation using tools like `LocalConfiguration` and `LocalDensity`.

## Using WindowSizeClass

Window size classes are a set of opinionated breakpoints that help you design, develop, and test adaptive layouts.

With `WindowSizeClass`, you can change your app layout as the display space available to your app changes. For example,
when the device orientation changes, or the app window is resized in multiâ€‘window mode.

The window size classes categorize the display area available to your app into three categories for both width and height:
compact, medium, and expanded. As you make layout changes, test the layout behavior across all window sizes, 
especially at the different breakpoint widths.

Learn more about adaptive layouts in the [Jetpack Compose documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/layouts/adaptive).

## Previewing layouts

We have three different @Preview:

* Android-specific, for `androidMain`, from Android Studio.
* Separate desktop annotation plugin with our own implementation (only for desktop source set) + uiTooling plugin.
* Common annotation, also supported in Android Studio, works for Android only but from common code.
