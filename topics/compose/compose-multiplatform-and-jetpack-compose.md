This article explains the relationship between Compose Multiplatform and Jetpack Compose.
You'll learn how the two toolkits align, how libraries are handled across targets,
and how to create or adapt your own UI libraries for multiplatform projects.
</tldr>

Compose Multiplatform is a cross-platform UI toolkit developed by JetBrains.
It extends Google's [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) toolkit for Android
by supporting additional target platforms.

Compose Multiplatform makes compose APIs available from [common Kotlin code](multiplatform-discover-project.md#common-code),
allowing you to write shared compose UI code that can run on Android, iOS, desktop, and web.

## Jetpack Compose and composables

Jetpack Compose is a declarative UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces.
Its foundation is _composable_ functions, marked with the `@Composable` annotation.
These functions define parts of the UI and automatically update when the underlying data changes.
You can combine composables to build layouts, handle user input, manage state, and apply animations.
Jetpack Compose includes common UI components like `Text`, `Button`, `Row`, and `Column`, which you can customize with modifiers.

Compose Multiplatform builds on the same principles. 
It shares the Compose compiler and runtime with Jetpack Compose and uses the same APIs â€” `@Composable` functions,
state management tools like `remember`, layout components, modifiers, and animation support.
This means you can reuse your Jetpack Compose knowledge with Compose Multiplatform to build cross-platform UIs for Android,
iOS, desktop, and web.

Naturally, Compose Multiplatform has platform-specific features and considerations:

* The [Android-only components](compose-android-only-components.md) page lists APIs that are closely tied to the 
Android platform and are therefore not available from common Compose Multiplatform code.
* Some platform-specific APIs, such as window handling APIs for desktop or the UIKit compatibility APIs for iOS,
are only available on their respective platforms.

Here's an overview of the availability of popular components and APIs:

## Technical details

Compose Multiplatform builds on code and releases published by Google.
While Google's focus is Jetpack Compose for Android,
there is close collaboration between Google and JetBrains to enable Compose Multiplatform.

Jetpack includes first-party libraries such as Foundation and Material, 
which Google publishes for Android.
To make the APIs provided by [these libraries](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-core) available from common code, 
JetBrains maintains multiplatform versions of these libraries, which are published for targets other than Android.

{style="tip"}

When you build your Compose Multiplatform application for Android, you use the Jetpack Compose artifacts published by Google.
For example, if you add `compose.material3` to your dependencies, your project will use `androidx.compose.material3:material3` 
in the Android target, and `org.jetbrains.compose.material3:material3` in other targets. 
This is done automatically, based on Gradle Module Metadata in the multiplatform artifacts.

## Libraries for Compose Multiplatform

By using Compose Multiplatform, you can publish your libraries
that use compose APIs as [Kotlin Multiplatform libraries](multiplatform-publish-lib-setup.md). 
This makes them available for use from common Kotlin code, targeting multiple platforms.

So if you're building a new library with compose APIs, consider taking advantage of that and building it as a multiplatform library using Compose Multiplatform.
If you've already built a Jetpack Compose library for Android, consider making that library multiplatform. 
There are already [many Compose Multiplatform libraries](https://github.com/terrakok/kmp-awesome#-compose-ui) available in the ecosystem.

When a library is published with Compose Multiplatform, apps that only use Jetpack Compose are still able to consume it seamlessly;
they simply use the Android artifacts of the library.
