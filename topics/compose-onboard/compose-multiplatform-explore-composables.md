Let's examine closely the sample composable created by the Kotlin Multiplatform wizard. First, there is the
composable `App()` function that implements the common UI and can be used on all platforms. Second, there is the
platform-specific code that launches this UI on each platform.

## Implementing composable functions

In the `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt` file, take a look at the `App()` function:

```kotlin
@Composable
@Preview
fun App() {
    MaterialTheme {
        var showContent by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
        Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
            Button(onClick = { showContent = !showContent }) {
                Text("Click me!")
            }
            AnimatedVisibility(showContent) {
                val greeting = remember { Greeting().greet() }
                Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
                    Image(painterResource(Res.drawable.compose_multiplatform), null)
                    Text("Compose: $greeting")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `App()` function is a regular Kotlin function annotated with `@Composable`. These kinds of functions are referred to
as _composable
functions_ or just _composables_. They are the building blocks of a UI based on Compose Multiplatform.

A composable function has the following general structure:

* The `MaterialTheme` sets the look of the application. The default settings can be customized. For example, you can
  choose colors, shapes, and typography.
* The `Column` composable controls the layout of the application. Here, it displays a `Button` above
  the `AnimatedVisibility` composable.
* The `Button` contains the `Text` composable, which renders some text.
* The `AnimatedVisibility` shows and hides the `Image` using an animation.
* The `painterResource` loads a vector icon stored in an XML resource.

The `horizontalAlignment` parameter of the `Column` centers its content. But for this to have any effect, the column
should take up the full width of its container. This is achieved using the `modifier` parameter.

Modifiers are a key component of Compose Multiplatform. This is a primary mechanism you use to adjust the appearance or
behavior of composables in the UI. Modifiers are created using methods of the `Modifier` type. When you chain these
methods, each call can change the `Modifier` returned from the previous call, making the order significant.
See the [JetPack Compose documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/modifiers) for more details.

### Managing the state

The final aspect of the sample composable is how the state is managed. The `showContent` property in the `App`
composable is built using the `mutableStateOf()` function, which means it's a state object that can be observed:

```kotlin
var showContent by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
```

The state object is wrapped in a call to the `remember()` function, meaning that it's built once and then
retained by the framework. By executing this, you create a property whose value is a state object containing a boolean.
The framework caches this state object, allowing composables to observe it.

When the value of the state changes, any composables that observe it are re-invoked. This allows any of the widgets they
produce to be redrawn. This is called a _recomposition_.

In your application, the only place where the state is changed is in the click event of the button. The `onClick` event
handler flips the value of the `showContent` property and invokes the `greeting` property with the platform name.

The changes occur when the image is shown or hidden because the parent `AnimatedVisibility` composable observes `showContent`.

## Launching UI on different platforms

The `App()` function execution is different for each platform. On Android, it's managed by an activity; on iOS, by a view 
controller; on the desktop, by a window; and on the web, by a container. Let's examine each of them.

### On Android

For Android, open the `MainActivity.kt` file in `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin`:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        setContent {
            App()
        }
    }
}
```

This is an [Android activity](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities)
called `MainActivity` that invokes the `App` composable.

### On iOS

For iOS, open the `MainViewController.kt` file in `composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin`:

```kotlin
fun MainViewController() = ComposeUIViewController { App() }
```

This is a [view controller](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers) that performs the same
role as an activity on Android. Notice that both the iOS and Android types simply invoke the `App` composable.

### On desktop

For desktop, look at the `main()` function in `composeApp/src/desktopMain/kotlin`:

```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    Window(onCloseRequest = ::exitApplication, title = "ComposeDemo") {
        App()
    }
}
```

* Here, the `application()` function launches a new desktop application.
* This function takes a lambda, where you initialize the UI. Typically, you create a `Window` and specify properties and
  instructions that dictate how the program should react when the window is closed. In this case, the whole application shuts down.
* Inside this window, you can place your content. As with Android and iOS, the only content is the `App()` function.

Currently, the `App` function doesn't declare any parameters. In a larger application, you typically pass parameters to
platform-specific dependencies. These dependencies could be created by hand or using a dependency injection library.

### On web

In the `composeApp/src/wasmJsMain/kotlin/main.kt` file, take a look at the `main()` function:

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalComposeUiApi::class)
fun main() {
    ComposeViewport(document.body!!) { App() }
}
```

* The `@OptIn(ExperimentalComposeUiApi::class)` annotation tells the compiler that you are using an API marked as
  experimental and may change in future releases.
* The `ComposeViewport()` function sets up the Compose environment for the application.
* The web app is inserted into the container specified as a parameter for the `ComposeViewport` function.
  In the example, the entire document's body works as the container.
* The `App()` function is responsible for building the UI components of your application using Jetpack Compose.
