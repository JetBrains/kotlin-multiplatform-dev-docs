[//]: # (title: Get started with Compose Multiplatform — tutorial)

With the [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) UI framework, you can push the
code-sharing capabilities of Kotlin Multiplatform beyond application logic. You can implement the user interface once
and then use it for all the platforms you target – iOS, Android, desktop, and web.

In this tutorial, you will build a sample application that runs on Android, iOS, and desktop. To create a user
interface, you will use the Compose Multiplatform framework and learn about its basics: composable functions, themes, layouts,
events, and modifiers.

* No previous experience of Compose Multiplatform, Android, or iOS is required for this tutorial. We recommend that
  you become familiar with the [fundamentals of Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html) before starting
  this tutorial.
* To complete this tutorial, you'll only need Android Studio. It allows you to try multiplatform development on Android
  and desktop. For iOS, you need a macOS machine with XCode installed. This is a general limitation of iOS development.
* You can choose only the platforms of interest to you and omit the others.
