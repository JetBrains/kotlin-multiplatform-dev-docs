[//]: # (title: Set up an environment)

Before you create your first Kotlin Multiplatform application, you need to set up an environment for KMP development.

## Install the necessary tools

We recommend that you install the latest stable versions for compatibility and better performance.

          <p>Most of the time, Xcode will work in the background. You will use it to add Swift or Objective-C code to your iOS application.</p>
            <note>
              <p>
                We generally recommend using the latest stable versions for all tools. However, Kotlin/Native sometimes doesn't support the newest Xcode right away. You can check supported versions in the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-compatibility-guide.html#version-compatibility">compatibility guide</a>, and if necessary, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Xcode">install an earlier version of Xcode</a>.

## Check your environment

To make sure everything works as expected, install and run the KDoctor tool:

> KDoctor works on macOS only. If you use a different operating system, skip this step.
>
{style="note"}

1. In the Android Studio terminal or your command-line tool, run the following command to install the tool using Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install kdoctor
    ```

   If you don't have Homebrew yet, [install it](https://brew.sh/) or see the KDoctor [README](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor#installation) for other ways to install it.
2. After the installation is completed, call KDoctor in the console: 

    ```bash
    kdoctor
    ```

3. If KDoctor diagnoses any problems while checking your environment, review the output for issues and possible solutions:

   * Fix any failed checks (`[x]`). You can find problem descriptions and potential solutions after the `*` symbol.
   * Check the warnings (`[!]`) and successful messages (`[v]`). They may contain useful notes and tips, as well.
   
   > You may ignore KDoctor's warnings regarding the CocoaPods installation. In your first project, you will use a
   > different iOS framework distribution option.

         <li>Make sure that you have Android Studio installed. You can get it from its <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">official website.</a></li>
         <li>You may encounter the <code>Kotlin not configured</code> error. It's a known issue in Android Studio Giraffe 2022.3 that doesn't affect building and running projects. To avoid the error, click <strong>Ignore</strong> or upgrade to Android Studio Hedgehog 2023.1.</li>

           <li>Android Studio uses a bundled JDK to execute Gradle tasks. To configure the Gradle JDK in Android Studio, select <strong>Settings/Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Gradle</strong>.</li>
           <li>You might encounter issues related to <code>JAVA_HOME</code>. This environment variable specifies the location of the Java binary required for Xcode and Gradle. If so, follow KDoctor's tips to fix the issues.</li>

         <li><p>You may encounter <code>Error: can't grab Xcode schemes</code> or other issues regarding command line tools selection. In this case, do one of the following:</p>

               </li>
               <li>Alternatively, in Xcode, select <strong>Settings | Locations</strong>. In the <strong>Command Line Tools</strong> field, select your Xcode version.
