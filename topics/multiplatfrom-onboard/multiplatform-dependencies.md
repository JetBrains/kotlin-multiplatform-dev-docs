You've already created your first cross-platform Kotlin Multiplatform project! Now let's learn how to add dependencies
to third-party libraries, which is necessary for building successful cross-platform applications.

## Dependency types

There are two types of dependencies that you can use in Kotlin Multiplatform projects:

* _Multiplatform dependencies_. These are multiplatform libraries that support multiple targets and can be used in the
  common source set, `commonMain`.

  Many modern Android libraries already have multiplatform support, like [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/),
  [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and [Okio](https://square.github.io/okio/).
* _Native dependencies_. These are regular libraries from relevant ecosystems. In native projects you usually work with them
  using Gradle for Android and using CocoaPods or another dependency manager for iOS. 
  
  When you work with a shared module, typically, you still need native dependencies when you want to use platform APIs
  such as security storage. You can add native dependencies to the native source sets, `androidMain` and `iosMain`.

For both types of dependencies, you can use local and external repositories.

## Add a multiplatform dependency

> If you have experience developing Android apps, adding a multiplatform dependency is similar to adding a
> Gradle dependency in a regular Android project. The only difference is that you need to specify the source set.

Let's go back to the app and make the greeting a little more festive. In addition to the device information, add a
function to display the number of days left until New Year's Day. The `kotlinx-datetime` library, which has full
multiplatform support, is the most convenient way to work with dates in your shared code.

1. Open the `build.gradle.kts` file located in the `shared` directory.
2. Add the following dependency to the `commonMain` source set dependencies:

   ```kotlin
   kotlin {
       sourceSets {
           commonMain.dependencies {
               implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-datetime:%dateTimeVersion%")
           } 
       }
   }
   ```

3. Synchronize the Gradle files by clicking **Sync Now** in the notification.

4. In `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin`, create a new file `NewYear.kt` in the project directory.
5. Update the file with a short function that calculates
   the number of days from today until the New Year using the `date-time` date arithmetic:
   
   ```kotlin
   import kotlinx.datetime.*
   
   fun daysUntilNewYear(): Int {
       val today = Clock.System.todayIn(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault())
       val closestNewYear = LocalDate(today.year + 1, 1, 1)
       return today.daysUntil(closestNewYear)
   }
   
   fun daysPhrase(): String = "There are only ${daysUntilNewYear()} days left until New Year! ðŸŽ†"
   ```

6. In `Greeting.kt`, update the `Greeting` class to see the result:
    
    ```kotlin
    class Greeting {
        private val platform: Platform = getPlatform()
   
        fun greet(): List<String> = buildList {
            add(if (Random.nextBoolean()) "Hi!" else "Hello!")
            add("Guess what this is! > ${platform.name.reversed()}!")
            add(daysPhrase())
        }
    }
    ```

7. To see the results, re-run your **composeApp** and **iosApp** configurations from Android Studio:
