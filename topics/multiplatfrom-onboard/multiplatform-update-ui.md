To build the user interface, you'll use the [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) toolkit
for the Android part of your project and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) for the iOS one.
These are both declarative UI frameworks, and you'll see similarities in the UI implementations. In both cases,
you store the data in the `phrases` variable and later iterate over it to produce a list of `Text` items.

## Update the Android part

The `composeApp` module contains an Android application, defines its main activity and the UI views, and uses the
`shared` module as a regular Android library. The UI of the application uses the Compose Multiplatform framework.

Make some changes and see how they are reflected in the UI:

1. Navigate to the `App.kt` file in `composeApp/src/androidMain/kotlin`.
2. Find the `Greeting` class invocation. Select the `greet()` function, right-click it and select the **Go To** | **Declaration or Usages** menu item.
   You'll see that it's the same class from the `shared` module you edited in the previous step.
3. In `Greeting.kt`, update the `greet()` function:

   ```kotlin
   fun greet(): List<String> = buildList {
       add(if (Random.nextBoolean()) "Hi!" else "Hello!")
       add("Guess what this is! > ${platform.name.reversed()}!")
   }
   ```

   Now it returns a list of strings.

4. Go back to `App.kt` and update its definition:

   ```kotlin
   @Composable
   @Preview
   fun App() {
       MaterialTheme {
           val greeting = remember { Greeting().greet() }
   
           Column(
               modifier = Modifier.padding(all = 20.dp),
               verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp),
           ) {
               greeting.forEach { greeting ->
                   Text(greeting)
                   Divider()
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Here the `Column` composable shows each of the `Text` items, adding padding around them and space between them.

5. Follow Android Studio's suggestions to import the missing dependencies.
6. Now you can run the Android app to see how it displays the list:

## Work with the iOS module in Xcode

`iosApp` is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the `shared` module as an iOS
framework. The UI of the app is written in Swift.

Implement the same changes as in the Android app:

1. Find the `iosApp` folder at the root of your project in the **Project** tool window.
2. Inside `iosApp`, right-click the `iosApp.xcodeproj` folder and select **Open In** | **Xcode**.
3. In the `ContentView.swift` file, select the `greet()` function and use the <shortcut>⌃ ⌘ J</shortcut> shortcut,
   or right-click the function name and select **Jump to Definition**.

   You'll see the Objective-C declarations for the Kotlin functions defined in the `shared` module. Kotlin types are
   represented as Objective-C types when used from Objective-C/Swift. Here the `greet()` function
   returns `List<String>` in Kotlin and is seen from Swift as returning `NSArray<NSString>`. For more on type mappings,
   see [Interoperability with Swift/Objective-C](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-objc-interop.html).

4. If you run the app, it will display an array of strings: the Swift code that uses the `greet()` function
   doesn't take into account its changed declaration. Update the SwiftUI code to display a list of items:

   ```Swift
   struct ContentView: View {
       let phrases = Greeting().greet()
   
       var body: some View {
           List(phrases, id: \.self) {
               Text($0)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   * The results of the `greet()` call are stored in the `phrases` variable (`let` in Swift is similar to Kotlin's `val`).
   * The `List` function produces a list of `Text` items.

5. Run the app to see the changes:

## Next step

In the next part of the tutorial, you'll learn about dependencies and add a third-party library to expand
the functionality of your project.
