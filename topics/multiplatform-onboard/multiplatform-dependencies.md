You've already created your first cross-platform Kotlin Multiplatform project! Now let's learn how to add dependencies
to third-party libraries, which is necessary for building successful cross-platform applications.

## Dependency types

There are two types of dependencies that you can use in Kotlin Multiplatform projects:

* _Multiplatform dependencies_. These are multiplatform libraries that support multiple targets and can be used in the
  common source set, `commonMain`.

  Many modern Android libraries already have multiplatform support, like [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/),
  [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and [Okio](https://square.github.io/okio/). Find more multiplatform libraries on [klibs.io](https://klibs.io/),
  an experimental search service from JetBrains for discovering Kotlin Multiplatform libraries.

* _Native dependencies_. These are regular libraries from relevant ecosystems. In native projects you usually work with them
  using Gradle for Android and using CocoaPods or another dependency manager for iOS. 
  
  When you work with a shared module, typically, you still need native dependencies when you want to use platform APIs
  such as security storage. You can add native dependencies to the native source sets, `androidMain` and `iosMain`.

For both types of dependencies, you can use local and external repositories.

## Add a multiplatform dependency

> If you have experience developing Android apps, adding a multiplatform dependency is similar to adding a
> Gradle dependency in a regular Android project. The only difference is that you need to specify the source set.

Let's go back to the app and make the greeting a little more festive. In addition to the device information, add a
function to display the number of days left until New Year's Day. The `kotlinx-datetime` library, which has full
multiplatform support, is the most convenient way to work with dates in your shared code.

1. Open the `build.gradle.kts` file located in the `shared` directory.
2. Add the following dependency and the Kotlin time opt-in to the `commonMain` source set dependencies:

    ```kotlin
    kotlin {
        //... 
        sourceSets {
            all { languageSettings.optIn("kotlin.time.ExperimentalTime") }
   
            commonMain.dependencies {
                implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-datetime:%dateTimeVersion%")
            } 
        }
    }
    ```

3. Select the **Build | Sync Project with Gradle Files** menu item
   or click the **Sync Gradle Changes** button in the build script editor to synchronize Gradle files: ![Synchronize Gradle files](gradle-sync.png){width=50}
4. Right-click the `shared/src/commonMain/.../greetingkmp` directory and select **New | Kotlin Class/File** to create a new file, `NewYear.kt`.
5. Update the file with a short function that calculates
   the number of days from today until the New Year using the `datetime` date arithmetic:
   
   ```kotlin
   @OptIn(ExperimentalTime::class)
   fun daysUntilNewYear(): Int {
       val today = Clock.System.todayIn(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault())
       val closestNewYear = LocalDate(today.year + 1, 1, 1)
       return today.daysUntil(closestNewYear)
   }
   
   fun daysPhrase(): String = "There are only ${daysUntilNewYear()} days left until New Year! ðŸŽ†"
   ```
6. Add all necessary imports as suggested by the IDE.
7. In the `Greeting.kt` file, update the `Greeting` class to see the result:
    
    ```kotlin
    class Greeting {
        private val platform: Platform = getPlatform()
   
        fun greet(): List<String> = buildList {
            add(if (Random.nextBoolean()) "Hi!" else "Hello!")
            add("Guess what this is! > ${platform.name.reversed()}!")
            add(daysPhrase())
        }
    }
    ```

8. To see the results, re-run your **composeApp** and **iosApp** configurations from IntelliJ IDEA:

In the next part of the tutorial, you'll add more dependencies and more complex logic to your project.
