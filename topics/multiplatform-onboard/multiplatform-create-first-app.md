Here you will learn how to create and run your first Kotlin Multiplatform application using IntelliJ IDEA.

Kotlin Multiplatform technology simplifies the development of cross-platform projects.
Kotlin Multiplatform applications can work on a variety of platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, web, and others.

One of the major Kotlin Multiplatform use cases is sharing code between mobile platforms.
You can share application logic between iOS and Android apps and write platform-specific code only when you need to implement a native UI or work with platform APIs.

## Create a project

1. In the [quickstart](quickstart.md), complete the instructions to [set up your environment for Kotlin Multiplatform development](quickstart.md#set-up-the-environment).
2. In IntelliJ IDEA, select **File** | **New** | **Project**.
3. In the panel on the left, select **Kotlin Multiplatform**.
4. Specify the following fields in the **New Project** window:
   * **Name**: GreetingKMP
   * **Group**: com.jetbrains.greeting
   * **Artifact**: greetingkmp
   
   ![Create Compose Multiplatform project](create-first-multiplatform-app.png){width=800}

5. Select **Android** and **iOS** targets.
6. For iOS, select the **Do not share UI** option to keep the UI native.
7. Once you've specified all the fields and targets, click **Create**.

> IntelliJ IDEA may automatically suggest upgrading the Android Gradle plugin in the project to the latest version.
> We don't recommend upgrading as Kotlin Multiplatform is not compatible with the latest AGP version
> (see the [compatibility table](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-compatibility-guide.html#version-compatibility)).

## Examine the project structure

In IntelliJ IDEA, expand the `GreetingKMP` folder.

This Kotlin Multiplatform project includes three modules:

* _shared_ is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications – the code you share
  between platforms. It uses [Gradle](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle.html) as the build system to help automate your build process.
* _composeApp_ is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system.
  The composeApp module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.
* _iosApp_ is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as an iOS
  framework. The shared module can be used as a regular framework or as a [CocoaPods dependency](multiplatform-cocoapods-overview.md).
  By default, Kotlin Multiplatform projects created in IntelliJ IDEA use the regular framework dependency.

![Basic Multiplatform project structure](basic-project-structure.svg){width=700}

The shared module consists of three source sets: `androidMain`, `commonMain`, and `iosMain`. _Source set_ is a Gradle
concept for a number of files logically grouped together where each group has its own dependencies.
In Kotlin Multiplatform, different source sets in a shared module can target different platforms.

The common source set contains shared Kotlin code, and platform source sets use Kotlin code specific to each target.
Kotlin/JVM is used for `androidMain` and Kotlin/Native for `iosMain`:

![Source sets and modules structure](basic-project-structure-2.png){width=350}

When the shared module is built into an Android library, common Kotlin code is treated as Kotlin/JVM.
When it is built into an iOS framework, common Kotlin is treated as Kotlin/Native:

![Common Kotlin, Kotlin/JVM, and Kotlin/Native](modules-structure.png)

### Write common declarations

The common source set contains shared code that can be used across multiple target platforms.
It's designed to contain code that is platform-independent. If you try to use platform-specific APIs in the common source set,
the IDE will show a warning:

1. Open the `shared/src/commonMain/.../Greeting.kt` file
    where you can find an automatically generated `Greeting` class with a `greet()` function:

    ```kotlin
    class Greeting {
        private val platform = getPlatform()

        fun greet(): String {
            return "Hello, ${platform.name}!"
        }
    }
    ```

2. Let's add a bit of variety to the greeting.
   Update the shared code with randomization and the `reversed()` call from the Kotlin standard library to reverse the text:

    ```kotlin
    class Greeting {
        private val platform: Platform = getPlatform()

        fun greet(): String {
            //
            val firstWord = if (Random.nextBoolean()) "Hi!" else "Hello!"

            return "$firstWord Guess what this is! > ${platform.name.reversed()}!"
        }
    }
    ```
3. Import the `kotlin.random.Random` class following the IDE's suggestion.

Writing the code only in common Kotlin has obvious limitations because it can't use any platform-specific functionality.
Using interfaces and the [expect/actual](multiplatform-connect-to-apis.md) mechanism solves this.

### Check out platform-specific implementations

The common source set can define expected declarations (interfaces, classes, and so on).
Then each platform source set, in this case `androidMain` and `iosMain`,
has to provide actual platform-specific implementations for the expected declarations.

While generating the code for a specific platform, the Kotlin compiler merges expected and actual declarations
and generates a single declaration with actual implementations.

1. When creating a Kotlin Multiplatform project with IntelliJ IDEA,
   you get a template with the `Platform.kt` file in the `commonMain` module:

    ```kotlin
    interface Platform {
        val name: String
    }
    ```

   It's a common `Platform` interface with information about the platform.

2. Switch between the `androidMain` and the `iosMain` modules.
   You'll see that they have different implementations of the same functionality for the Android and the iOS source sets:
    
    ```kotlin
    // Platform.android.kt in the androidMain module:
    import android.os.Build

    class AndroidPlatform : Platform {
        override val name: String = "Android ${Build.VERSION.SDK_INT}"
    }
    ```
   
    ```kotlin
    // Platform.ios.kt in the iosMain module:
    import platform.UIKit.UIDevice
    
    class IOSPlatform: Platform {
        override val name: String =
            UIDevice.currentDevice.systemName() + " " + UIDevice.currentDevice.systemVersion
    }
    ```

    * The `name` property implementation from `AndroidPlatform` uses the Android-specific code, namely the `android.os.Build`
      dependency. This code is written in Kotlin/JVM. If you try to access a JVM-specific class, such as `java.util.Random` here, this code will compile.
    * The `name` property implementation from `IOSPlatform` uses iOS-specific code, namely the `platform.UIKit.UIDevice`
      dependency. It's written in Kotlin/Native, meaning you can write iOS code in Kotlin. This code becomes a part of the iOS
      framework, which you will later call from Swift in your iOS application.

3. Check the `getPlatform()` function in different source sets. Its expected declaration doesn't have a body,
   and actual implementations are provided in the platform code:

    ```kotlin
    // Platform.kt in the commonMain source set
    expect fun getPlatform(): Platform
    ```
   
    ```kotlin
    // Platform.android.kt in the androidMain source set
    actual fun getPlatform(): Platform = AndroidPlatform()
    ```
   
    ```kotlin
    // Platform.ios.kt in the iosMain source set
    actual fun getPlatform(): Platform = IOSPlatform()
    ```

Here, the common source set defines an expected `getPlatform()` function and has actual implementations,
`AndroidPlatform()` for the Android app and `IOSPlatform()` for the iOS app, in the platform source sets.

While generating the code for a specific platform, the Kotlin compiler merges expected and actual declarations
into a single `getPlatform()` function with its actual implementations.

That's why expected and actual declarations should be defined in the same package – they are merged into one declaration
in the resulting platform code. Any invocation of the expected `getPlatform()` function in the generated platform code
calls a correct actual implementation.

Now you can run the apps and see all of this in action.

#### Explore the expect/actual mechanism (optional) {initial-collapse-state="collapsed" collapsible="true"}

The template project uses the expect/actual mechanism for functions, but it also works for most Kotlin declarations,
such as properties and classes. Let's implement an expected property:

1. Open `Platform.kt` in the `commonMain` module and add the following at the end of the file:

   ```kotlin
   expect val num: Int
   ```

   The Kotlin compiler complains that this property has no corresponding actual declarations in the platform modules.

2. Try to provide the implementation right away with:

   ```kotlin
   expect val num: Int = 42
   ```

   You'll get an error saying that expected declarations must not have a body, in this case an initializer.
   The implementations must be provided in actual platform modules. Remove the initializer.
3. Hover the `num` property and click **Create missed actuals...**.
   Choose the `androidMain` source set. You can then complete the implementation in `androidMain/Platform.android.kt`:

   ```kotlin
   actual val num: Int = 1
    ```

4. Now provide the implementation for the `iosMain` module. Add the following to `iosMain/Platform.ios.kt`:

   ```kotlin
   actual val num: Int = 2
   ```

5. In the `commonMain/Greeting.kt` file, add the `num` property to the `greet()` function to see the differences:

   ```kotlin
   fun greet(): String {
       val firstWord = if (Random.nextBoolean()) "Hi!" else "Hello!"
  
       return "$firstWord [$num] Guess what this is! > ${platform.name.reversed()}!"
   }
   ```

## Run your application

You can run your multiplatform application for both [Android](#run-your-application-on-android)
or [iOS](#run-your-application-on-ios) from IntelliJ IDEA.

If you have explored the expect/actual mechanism earlier, you can see "[1]" added to the greeting for Android
and "[2]" added for iOS.

### Run your application on Android

1. In the list of run configurations, select **composeApp**.
2. Choose an Android virtual device next to the list of configurations and click **Run**.

   If you don't have a device in the list, create a [new Android virtual device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd).

<include from="compose-multiplatform-create-first-app.md" element-id="run_android_other_devices"/>

### Run your application on iOS

If you haven't launched Xcode as part of the initial setup, do that before running the iOS app.

In IntelliJ IDEA, select **iosApp** in the list of run configurations, select a simulated device next to the run configuration,
and click **Run**.

If you don't have an available iOS configuration in the list, add a [new run configuration](#run-on-a-new-ios-simulated-device).
