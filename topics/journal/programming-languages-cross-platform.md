You’ve probably started to notice the term [cross-platform development](cross-platform-mobile-development.md) popping up more and more frequently these days. Indeed, cross-platform programming is becoming increasingly popular in the context of software development. It is particularly prevalent in the area of mobile apps, but its use is by no means limited to these types of applications. As businesses strive to reach broader audiences across multiple devices and operating systems, developers are turning to versatile languages and frameworks that erase platform barriers.

If you’re wondering which programming language would best equip you to get started with cross-platform development, this overview article will steer you in the right direction, offering insights and real use-case examples.

## Understanding cross-platform development

Cross-platform application development refers to the development approach where a single codebase can be used to create software that runs on multiple platforms, such as iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and web browsers, among others. This approach has gained popularity in recent years, thanks in large part to the growing demand for mobile apps. Mobile engineers can share some or all of the source code between iOS and Android instead of developing separate applications for each platform.

We have a dedicated guide where you can read more about the benefits and limitations of both [native and cross-platform development](native-and-cross-platform.md) and how to choose between these two approaches. Some of the main advantages of cross-platform development include:

1. **Cost-effectiveness.** Building separate apps for each platform can be expensive in terms of both time and resources. With cross-platform development, developers can write code once and deploy it across multiple platforms, reducing development costs.

2. **Faster development.** This approach helps to accelerate the development process by making it so that developers only need to write and maintain a single codebase.

3. **Efficient and flexible code sharing.** Modern cross-platform technologies enable developers to reuse code across multiple platforms while maintaining the advantages of native programming.

4. **Consistent user experiences across platforms.** Cross-platform development ensures that key behaviors, such as calculations or workflows, deliver the same results on different platforms when needed. This helps maintain consistency, providing users with the same experience whether they are on iOS, Android, or other devices and operating systems.

In this article, we will discuss some of the most popular programming languages for cross-platform development.
