### Variable fonts

Compose Multiplatform now supports variable fonts on all platforms. With variable fonts, you can only keep one font file 
with all style preferences such as weight, width, slant, italic, custom axes, visual weight with typographic color, 
and style adaptable to specific text sizes.

For details, see the [Jetpack Compose documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/text/fonts#variable-fonts).
