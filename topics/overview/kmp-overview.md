Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is an open-source technology from JetBrains that enables sharing code across Android, iOS, desktop,
web, and server while retaining the advantages of native development.

With Compose Multiplatform, you can also share UI code across multiple platforms for maximum code reuse.

## Why companies choose KMP

### Cost efficiency and faster delivery

Kotlin Multiplatform helps streamline both technical and organizational processes:

* You can reduce duplication and maintenance costs by sharing logic and UI code across platforms.
This also makes it possible to release features simultaneously on multiple platforms.
* Team collaboration becomes easier because unified logic is accessible in shared code, making
it easier to transfer knowledge between team members, and reduce duplication of effort between dedicated platform teams.

In addition to faster time to market, **55%** users reported improved collaboration after adopting KMP
and **65%** of teams reported improved performance and quality, (in the KMP Survey Q2 2024).

KMP is used in production by organizations of all sizes, from startups to global enterprises.
Companies like Google, Duolingo, Forbes, Philips, McDonald's, Bolt, H&M, Baidu, Kuaishou, and Bilibili have adopted KMP for its flexibility, native performance, ability to deliver native user experiences,
cost efficiency, and support for gradual adoption. [Learn more about companies who have adopted KMP](case-studies.topic).

### Flexibility of code sharing

You can share code on your terms: share isolated modules, such as networking or storage, and progressively
expand shared code over time.
You can also share all of your business logic while keeping the UI native, or gradually migrate the UI
using Compose Multiplatform.

### Native feel on iOS

You can build your UI entirely using SwiftUI or UIKit, create a uniform experience on Android and iOS with Compose Multiplatform,
or mix and match native and shared UI code as needed.

Regardless of the approach, you can produce apps which feel native on each platform:

### Native performance

Kotlin Multiplatform leverages [Kotlin/Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html)
to produce native binaries and access platform APIs directly where virtual machines are undesirable or impossible,
for example, on iOS.

This helps achieve near-native performance while writing platform-agnostic code:

### Seamless tooling

IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio provide smart IDE support for KMP with the [Kotlin Multiplatform IDE plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
common UI previews, [hot reload for Compose Multiplatform](compose-hot-reload.md), cross-language navigation, refactorings, and debugging across Kotlin and Swift code.

## Discover Kotlin Multiplatform use cases

Look at how companies and developers already enjoy the benefits of shared Kotlin code:

* Learn how companies have successfully adopted KMP in their codebases on our [case studies page](case-studies.topic).
* Check out a wide range of sample apps in our [curated sample list](multiplatform-samples.md) and the GitHub [kotlin-multiplatform-sample](https://github.com/topics/kotlin-multiplatform-sample) topic.
* Search for specific multiplatform libraries among the thousands already present on [klibs.io](https://klibs.io/).

## Learn the basics

To quickly see KMP in action, try the [quickstart](quickstart.md).
You'll set up your environment and run a sample application on different platforms.

Choose a use case
: * To create an app that shares both UI and business logic code between platforms,
follow the [shared logic and UI tutorial](compose-multiplatform-create-first-app.md).
  * To see how an Android app can be turned into a multiplatform app,
  check out our [migration tutorial](multiplatform-integrate-in-existing-app.md).
  * To see how you can share some code without sharing UI implementation,
  follow the [shared logic tutorial](multiplatform-create-first-app.md).

Dig into technical details
: * Start with the [basic project structure](multiplatform-discover-project.md).
  * Learn about the available [sharing code mechanisms](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md).
  * See [how dependencies work](multiplatform-add-dependencies.md) in a KMP project.
  * Consider different [iOS integration methods](multiplatform-ios-integration-overview.md).
  * Learn how KMP [compiles code](multiplatform-configure-compilations.md) and [builds binaries](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md)
    for various targets.
  * Read about [publishing a multiplatform app](multiplatform-publish-apps.md)
    or a [multiplatform library](multiplatform-publish-lib-setup.md).
