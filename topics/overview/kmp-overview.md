[//]: # (title: What is Kotlin Multiplatform)

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a technology that allows reusing code across Android, iOS, desktop, web, and server-side
while integrating with native code where needed.

## Discover Kotlin Multiplatform

You can find case studies of companies who already enjoy the benefits of shared Kotlin code on our [overview page](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/).

There is also a wealth of smaller sample apps in our [curated sample list](multiplatform-samples.md),
as well as in the GitHub [kotlin-multiplatform-sample](https://github.com/topics/kotlin-multiplatform-sample)
topic.

Finally, you can look for multiplatform libraries that may solve your problems on [klibs.io](https://klibs.io/).

## Learning the basics

You can start with something you're interested 

TODO: "Depending on your level of understanding..."

* To quickly see Kotlin Multiplatform in action, try the [quickstart](quickstart.md).
  You'll set up your environment and run a sample application on different platforms.
  * To try creating an app that shares most of the code between platforms,
    see the [shared logic and UI tutorial](compose-multiplatform-create-first-app.md).
  * To see how an Android app can be turned into a multiplatform app,
    check out our [migration tutorial](multiplatform-integrate-in-existing-app.md).
  * To see how you can share some code without sharing UI implementation,
    follow the [shared logic tutorial](multiplatform-create-first-app.md).
* If you want to dig into technical details:
  * Start with the [basic project structure](multiplatform-discover-project.md).
  * Learn about the available [sharing code mechanisms](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md).
  * See [how dependencies work](multiplatform-add-dependencies.md) in a KMP project.
  * Consider different [iOS integration methods](multiplatform-ios-integration-overview.md).
  * Learn how KMP [compiles code](multiplatform-configure-compilations.md) and [builds binaries](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md)
    for various targets.

## Adopting Kotlin Multiplatform

Adopting a cross-platform framework in a team can be a challenge.
To learn about benefits and solutions to potential problems, take a look at our high-level overviews
of cross-platform development:

* [](cross-platform-mobile-development.md) Talks about different approaches and implementations of cross-platform applications.
* [](multiplatform-introduce-your-team.md). Suggests an approach to introducing cross-platform development in a team.
* [](multiplatform-reasons-to-try.md). Lists reasons to adopt Kotlin Multiplatform in particular as a cross-platform solution.
