[//]: # (title: What is Kotlin Multiplatform)

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a technology that allows reusing code across Android, iOS, desktop, web, and server-side
while integrating with native code where needed.

## Why you should adopt Kotlin Multiplatform

Kotlin Multiplatform allows you to build more efficiently and launch faster:

* **Share code across platforms** to reduce development and maintenance costs.
  Focus on features, not duplication.
* **Launch faster** by shipping updates simultaneously across platforms with one team and one workflow.
* **Build with smaller, smarter teams.**
  KMP lets one team own the entire app without splitting into iOS and Android silos.
* **Start small – share one module or screen.**
  Scale when it makes sense.
  Avoid risky rewrites.
* **Follow the big players:**
  KMP is used by startups as well as scale-ups like 9GAG, Wrike, and Instabee.
  It’s trusted by high-growth, high-demand apps.
* **See real impact:** In addition to faster time to market, 65% of teams reported improved performance and quality,
  and 55% reported improved collaboration after adopting KMP, based on the KMP Survey 2024.
* **Use one language for everything:** Use Kotlin across your entire stack – from backend to shared code on Android, iOS, desktop, and web
  – thanks to Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform.
* **Leverage your team’s existing skills** in Kotlin and Jetpack to build apps across platforms. Minimize learning curves and the time needed to get started.
* **Delegate routine tasks** to [Junie](https://www.jetbrains.com/junie/), the coding agent by JetBrains which can already handle Kotlin Multiplatform,
  and focus on what really matters.

## Discover Kotlin Multiplatform use cases

Look at how companies and developers already enjoy the benefits of shared Kotlin code:

* Learn how companies have successfully adopted KMP in their codebases on our [case studies page](case-studies.topic).
* Check out a wide range of sample apps in our [curated sample list](multiplatform-samples.md) and the GitHub [kotlin-multiplatform-sample](https://github.com/topics/kotlin-multiplatform-sample) topic.
* Search for specific multiplatform libraries among the thousands already present on [klibs.io](https://klibs.io/).

## Learn the basics

You can learn KMP fundamentals in a way that suits you: 

* To quickly see Kotlin Multiplatform in action, try the [quickstart](quickstart.md).
  You'll set up your environment and run a sample application on different platforms.
  * To create an app that shares both UI and business logic code between platforms,
    follow the [shared logic and UI tutorial](compose-multiplatform-create-first-app.md).
  * To see how an Android app can be turned into a multiplatform app,
    check out our [migration tutorial](multiplatform-integrate-in-existing-app.md).
  * To see how you can share some code without sharing UI implementation,
    follow the [shared logic tutorial](multiplatform-create-first-app.md).
* If you want to dig into technical details:
  * Start with the [basic project structure](multiplatform-discover-project.md).
  * Learn about the available [sharing code mechanisms](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md).
  * See [how dependencies work](multiplatform-add-dependencies.md) in a KMP project.
  * Consider different [iOS integration methods](multiplatform-ios-integration-overview.md).
  * Learn how KMP [compiles code](multiplatform-configure-compilations.md) and [builds binaries](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md)
    for various targets.
  * Read about [publishing a multiplatform app](multiplatform-publish-apps.md)
    or a [multiplatform library](multiplatform-publish-lib-setup.md).
