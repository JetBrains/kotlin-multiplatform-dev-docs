[//]: # (title: What is Kotlin Multiplatform)

Kotlin Multiplatform is a technology that allows reusing code across Android, iOS, desktop, web, and server-side
while integrating with native code where needed.

You can find case studies of big companies who already enjoy the benefits of shared code on our [overview page](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/).

## Learning about Kotlin Multiplatform

Our [Get started](get-started.topic) page lays out the primary use cases:
you can choose the one that is closest to your situation and get into the corresponding tutorial for KMP beginners.

* If you'd rather get straight into it and see what Kotlin Multiplatform has to offer with your own eyes, try the [quickstart](quickstart.md).
  It helps to quickly set up your environment and run a sample application on different platforms.
* If you want to dig into technical details:
  * Start with the [basic project structure](multiplatform-discover-project.md).
  * Learn about the available [sharing code mechanisms](multiplatform-share-on-platforms.md).
  * See [how dependencies work](multiplatform-add-dependencies.md) in a KMP project.
  * Consider different [iOS integration methods](multiplatform-ios-integration-overview.md).
  * Learn how KMP [compiles code](multiplatform-configure-compilations.md) and [builds binaries](multiplatform-build-native-binaries.md)
    for various targets.
