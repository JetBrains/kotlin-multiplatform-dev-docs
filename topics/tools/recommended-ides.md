## Fleet

If you want the best Kotlin Multiplatform development experience, we recommend using [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/).

It supports testing and debugging your code on all of the platforms your project targets. You can also navigate between Kotlin
Multiplatform code and code written in other languages interoperable with Kotlin.

See the [Use Fleet for Multiplatform development](fleet.md) tutorial to get started.

Kotlin Multiplatform support in Fleet is still in the early stages of development. You may face issues and
limitations, but we're committed to fixing them based on [your feedback](fleet.md#leave-feedback).

## Android Studio

As a more stable solution, you can use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio),
although its support for Kotlin Multiplatform is limited.

With Android Studio, you can also install a [special plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)
that provides minimal launching and debugging capabilities for iOS apps.

## Other IDEs

If basic Kotlin Multiplatform support is enough for you, you can use any IDE that supports Kotlin, including [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
It supports opening, browsing, and building multiplatform projects.

> If you're targeting iOS in your Kotlin Multiplatform project, you'll also need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
> installed on your machine to write iOS-specific code and run iOS applications.
