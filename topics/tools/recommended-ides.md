## Android Studio IDE

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is the most stable solution,
although its support for Kotlin Multiplatform is still limited.

With Android Studio, you can also install a [Kotlin Multiplatform plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)
that provides basic launching and debugging capabilities for iOS apps.

## Other IDEs and code editors

If basic Kotlin Multiplatform support is enough for you, you can use any IDE that supports Kotlin, including [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
It supports opening, browsing, and building multiplatform projects.

> If you're targeting iOS in your Kotlin Multiplatform project, you'll also need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
> installed on your machine to write iOS-specific code and run iOS applications.
