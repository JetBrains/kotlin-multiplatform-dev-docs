## JetBrains Fleet code editor

For the best Kotlin Multiplatform development experience, we recommend using [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/).  
Fleet is a code editor for any language that can transform into a more powerful tool for development.
It is designed to be smart and focused on core development workflows (the edit-build-run loop), 
AI-capable, and ready for remote development and collaboration.

Fleet supports testing and debugging your code on all target platforms. You can also navigate between Kotlin
Multiplatform code and code written in other languages interoperable with Kotlin.

See the [Use Fleet for Multiplatform development](fleet.md) tutorial to get started.

> Kotlin Multiplatform support in Fleet is still in the early stages of development. You may face issues and
> limitations, but we're committed to fixing them based on [your feedback](fleet.md#leave-feedback).

## Android Studio IDE

As a more stable solution, you can use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio),
although its support for Kotlin Multiplatform is limited.

With Android Studio, you can also install a [special plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)
that provides minimal launching and debugging capabilities for iOS apps.

## Other IDEs and code editors

If basic Kotlin Multiplatform support is enough for you, you can use any IDE that supports Kotlin, including [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
It supports opening, browsing, and building multiplatform projects.

> If you're targeting iOS in your Kotlin Multiplatform project, you'll also need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
> installed on your machine to write iOS-specific code and run iOS applications.
