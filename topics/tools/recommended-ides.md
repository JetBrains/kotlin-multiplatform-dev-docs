## IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) provides full Kotlin Multiplatform support.

On macOS with IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1.1.1,
you can install the [Kotlin Multiplatform IDE plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
that provides basic launching and debugging capabilities for iOS apps,
preflight environment checks, and other helpful KMP functionality.

## Android Studio

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is another stable solution for Kotlin Multiplatform.

On macOS with Android Studio Narwhal 2025.1.1 (currently at RC 1),
you can install the [Kotlin Multiplatform IDE plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
that provides basic launching and debugging capabilities for iOS apps,
preflight environment checks, and other helpful KMP functionality.

## Other IDEs and code editors

If basic Kotlin Multiplatform support is enough for you, you can use any IDE that supports Kotlin.

> If you're targeting iOS in your Kotlin Multiplatform project, you'll also need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
> installed on your machine to write iOS-specific code and run iOS applications.
