[//]: # (title: Recommended IDEs and code editors)

## IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) provides full Kotlin Multiplatform support.

With IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2.2,
you can install the [Kotlin Multiplatform IDE plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
that provides basic launching and debugging capabilities for iOS apps,
preflight environment checks, and other helpful KMP functionality.

## Android Studio

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is another stable solution for Kotlin Multiplatform.

With Android Studio Otter 2025.2.1,
you can install the [Kotlin Multiplatform IDE plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform)
that provides basic launching and debugging capabilities for iOS apps,
preflight environment checks, and other helpful KMP functionality.

## Xcode

If you're targeting iOS in your Kotlin Multiplatform project, you need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
installed on your machine to write iOS-specific code and run iOS applications.

To upload your apps to App Store Connect, build them with Xcode 16 or later.

## Other IDEs and code editors

If basic Kotlin Multiplatform support is enough for you, you can use any IDE that supports Kotlin.
