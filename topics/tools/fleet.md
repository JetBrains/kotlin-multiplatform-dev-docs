[//]: # (title: Use Fleet for Multiplatform development — tutorial)

This article shows the basics of working with Kotlin Multiplatform projects
in [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/).

Fleet is a code editor for any language that can transform into a powerful development tool for any language. 
It strives to provide a superior experience for Kotlin Multiplatform.
As the first step, Fleet brings Kotlin Multiplatform to macOS.

With Fleet, you can quickly open and run multiplatform projects targeting Android, iOS, web, and desktop platforms.
Fleet's Smart Mode automatically selects the appropriate code-processing engine.

When targeting iOS, navigation, refactoring, and debugging are available across all languages used in the project.
This makes it easier to manage a mixed-language codebase.
Fleet fully supports Swift out of the box, so you can extend and maintain the native parts of your application.

## Prepare your development environment

> Currently, Fleet supports Kotlin Multiplatform only on macOS, so you'll need a Mac to complete this tutorial.

1. Install [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) app.

   The Toolbox app provides an easy upgrade path to new versions as they become available. You can also manage multiple
   versions of JetBrains products, working with stable releases while exploring experimental ones.

2. Log into Toolbox with your [JetBrains account](https://account.jetbrains.com/login).
3. Click **Install** next to the **Fleet** icon.
4. Check your version of the JDK. Currently, Fleet requires the Java Development Kit 17.0 and later to be installed for
   Kotlin Multiplatform development. To do that, run the following command in your command-line tool:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

5. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
   so that you can run your app on Android and iOS simulators.

   See [Set up an environment](multiplatform-setup.md) for more details on these prerequisites and
   information on how to use the KDoctor tool to verify your setup.

   * To ensure the installation is complete, open both Android Studio and Xcode at least once. It may also be necessary
     to reopen Android Studio and Xcode following an update.
   * To run and debug Android applications on the current machine, you'll need to create
     a [virtual device in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd).
   * If you experience problems running an iOS project, verify that you can run
     the embedded project in the `iosApp` folder from Xcode on this destination. Then restart Fleet.

## Get started with Fleet

When using Fleet, you can create a Multiplatform project by:

* Using the [Kotlin Multiplatform wizard](https://kmp.jetbrains.com/).
* [Cloning an existing Git repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/fleet/workspace.html#clone-project)
  with the **Clone from Git** option on the Fleet welcome screen.

### Create a project

In this tutorial, you'll create a new project with the web wizard:

1. Open the [Kotlin Multiplatform wizard](https://kmp.jetbrains.com).
2. On the **New project** tab, change the project name to "SampleProject" and use "com.example.project" as the project's ID.
3. Select the **Android**, **iOS**, and **Desktop** options as your platforms.
4. For iOS, make sure that the **Share UI** option is selected.
5. Click **Download** and unpack the resulting archive.

### Enable Smart Mode

1. Launch Fleet.
2. On the welcome screen, click **Open File or Folder** or select **File | Open** in the editor.
3. Navigate to the unpacked "SampleProject" folder and click **Open**.

   ![Fleet project wizard](fleet-project-wizard-1.png){width=700}

   Fleet detects the project type and opens it for you.

4. When opening a folder with a build file, Fleet gives you the option to enable
   [Smart Mode](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/fleet/smart-mode.html). Click **Trust and Open**:

   ![Smart mode in Fleet](fleet-project-wizard-2.png){width=700}

   At the top of the window, you'll see messages from Fleet as the project is imported and indexed.

When Smart Mode is enabled, Fleet offers language-related features such as code completion,
navigation, debugging, and refactoring. When Smart Mode is disabled, Fleet works as a simple code editor. 
You can quickly open files and make changes, but without most of the advanced language-related features.

Under the hood, Fleet chooses which backend to use to process code. When Smart Mode is enabled, the backend for
Kotlin is the same code-processing engine used by IntelliJ IDEA, so the functionality you might be already familiar with
is retained.

To check Smart Mode status, click the lightning bolt icon at the top:

![Enabling Smart Mode in Fleet](fleet-smart-mode.png){width=300}

### Run your project

When opening a project, Fleet creates [run configurations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/fleet/run-configs.html) for
the targets found in the build file. To access run configurations, you can:

* Use the <shortcut>⌘ R</shortcut> shortcut.
* Select **Run** | **Run & Debug** in the main menu.
* Click the ![Run configurations](fleet-run-icon.png){width=25}{type="joined"} icon at the top of the window.

![Run configurations](fleet-run-configurations.png){width=700}

Choose the `iosApp` configuration from the list and run it. The application will automatically be executed on the iPhone
simulator.

In the build window, you'll see how the application has been compiled and launched:

![Run the iOS app on the iPhone simulator](fleet-run-ios-app.png){width=700}

## Work with multiplatform code

The sample code generated by the web wizard provides a useful starting point for exploring Fleet functionality:
code navigation, editing, refactoring, and debugging in multiplatform projects.

For a detailed explanation of the sample code, see
the [Get started with the Compose Multiplatform](compose-multiplatform-explore-composables.md) tutorial.

### Navigating code

Let's see how cross-language navigation works in Fleet using the example of navigating from Kotlin to Swift:

1. Open the `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt` file. Here's the `App` composable, the center of the sample code.
2. Select the `App()` function and run the **Usages** action from the context menu or with the <shortcut>⌘ U</shortcut>
   shortcut. You can see it is invoked in three files:

   ![Function show usages](fleet-show-usages.png){width=700}

   This is where the `App` composable is used to launch the Android, iOS, and desktop targets.

3. Select the `MainViewController.kt` file. You'll see the `MainViewController` type that is invoked from Swift code.
4. Instead of manually browsing to find the Swift file that implements this functionality, navigate to it directly by
   using the **Usages** action again:

   <img src="fleet-navigation.png" alt="Using cross-language navigation in Fleet" width="700" animated="true"/>

   Because there is only one usage, Fleet automatically opens the file for you.

### Editing in multiple languages

Since the `ContentView.swift` file is already open, you can explore Fleet support for editing Swift code:

1. Add a new function to the `ComposeView` type. Fleet will provide all the expected coding assistance:

   ```swift
   struct ComposeView: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
       // …
       func sumArray(input: [Int]) -> String {
           var total = 0
           for item in input {
               total += item
           }
           return "Total value is \(total)"
       }
   }
   ```

   The completion and code hints work in Fleet as expected. For example, if you forget the `return` keyword,
   or return a value of the wrong type, Fleet will highlight the error.

2. Update `makeUIViewController()` to invoke the new function:

   ```swift
   func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> UIViewController {
       MainViewControllerKt.MainViewController(text: sumArray(input: [10,20,30,40]))
   }
   ```

3. Get back to the Kotlin code. Update the `MainViewController.kt` file to accommodate this change:

   ```kotlin
   fun MainViewController(text: String) = ComposeUIViewController { App(text) }
   ```

4. Adjust the `App` composable as well:

   ```kotlin
   @Composable
   fun App(text: String? = null) {
       MaterialTheme {
           var showContent by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
           val greeting = remember { Greeting().greet() }
           Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
               Button(onClick = { showContent = !showContent }) {
                   Text(text ?: greeting)
               }
               AnimatedVisibility(showContent) {
                   Column(Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally) {
                       Image(painterResource(Res.drawable.compose_multiplatform), null)
                       Text("Compose: $greeting")
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. Rerun the application on iOS:

   ![Editing in multiple languages](fleet-code-editing.png){width=300}

   The simulator displays the message from the new function instead of the original greeting.

### Refactoring across multiple languages

Navigation is not the only feature in Fleet which is cross-language. The same applies to refactoring.

You have already seen that the `MainViewController()` function is declared in Kotlin but invoked from Swift.

Select the `MainViewController()` function and use the **Rename** | **Refactoring** action to change its name
to `MainSwiftUIViewController`:

<img src="fleet-refactor-code.png" alt="Refactoring across multiple languages in Fleet" width="700" animated="true"/>

The function name is changed in both Kotlin and Swift files.

### Debugging

One more example of cross-language functionality is debugging. The Fleet debugger can automatically step between Swift
and Kotlin code.

1. In the `ContentView.swift` file, set a breakpoint on the return expression of the `sumArray()` function on line 17.
2. In `App.kt`, set a breakpoint in the `App` composable on line 23.
3. Open the **Run & Debug** menu and click **Debug** next to the `iosApp` configuration.
4. When the breakpoint on line 17 of `ContentView.swift` is reached, in the **Debug** menu, use **Step Out** to move to
   line 7.
5. To move into the `MainSwiftUIViewController()` Kotlin function, use **Step Into**.
6. Click **Resume** to move on to the breakpoint on line 23 of `App.kt`.

   ![Refactoring across multiple languages in Fleet](fleet-debug.png){width=700}

   The debugger shows that there are no errors in the code.
