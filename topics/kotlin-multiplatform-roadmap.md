# Kotlin Multiplatform roadmap

The Kotlin Multiplatform roadmap is meant as an overview of priorities and general direction for the Kotlin Multiplatform project.

The latest [roadmap blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2024/10/kotlin-multiplatform-development-roadmap-for-2025/)
was published on October 28, 2024.
The page below summarizes it and is updated whenever we reach a declared milestone.

Kotlin Multiplatform goals are closely aligned with the [Kotlin roadmap](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/roadmap.html).
Be sure to check it out to have more context for the direction we're taking.

## Key priorities

* Stable Compose Multiplatform for iOS: driving the iOS target to a stable release involves both improving the underlying framework
    and iOS-specific integrations and benchmarks.
* Public release of a standalone Kotlin Multiplatform IDE, tailored specifically for multiplatform development in an optimized
    environment.
* Release the first public version of Kotlin-to-Swift export. With the initial release, we aim to provide experience comparable
    to the existing Objective-C export, and pave the way to fully leverage Swift export in the future.
* Improve the experience of creating multiplatform libraries by providing better tools and guidance. We shall improve
    the klib format to be more flexible and powerful, and provide better templates and instructions for creating multiplatform
    libraries.
* Make Amper suitable for multiplatform mobile development. In 2025, Amper should fully support multiplatform development
    for iOS and Android, including sharing UI code using Compose Multiplatform.

You can find frequently asked questions and answers in the [FAQ section](#faq).

## Compose Multiplatform

Focus areas for Compose Multiplatform are:

* **Jetpack Compose feature parity**. Ensure that all core APIs and components are multiplatform.
* **iOS rendering performance**. Implement benchmarking infrastructure to catch regressions and make performance
    of the framework transparent to the users.
* **Feature completeness for core components**. Complete essential features, including:
    * navigation,
    * resource management,
    * accessibility,
    * internationalization.
* **General stabilization of the framework**. Improve overall stability (including interoperability between Compose and native views)
    while enhancing the user experience through Compose Multiplatform previews.
* **Documentation**. Provide users with all the resources needed to learn and use Compose Multiplatform in a single place.
* **Compose Multiplatform for web**. Reach feature parity with other supported platforms.

### Any plans regarding Compose HTML?

While continuing to maintain the Compose HTML library by fixing bugs, we are also exploring use cases for it among existing users
so that we can formulate plans for its future development.

## Tooling

We aim to ensure that Kotlin Multiplatform integrates seamlessly with the IDEs already commonly used for KMP development,
such as IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio, making it more straightforward to share code within or between projects.

We also believe that there is a place for a dedicated multiplatform IDE, and plan to release a standalone Kotlin Multiplatform IDE.
This IDE, based on [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/), will be tailored specifically for Kotlin Multiplatform development.
The initial release will focus on mobile scenarios and aim to:

* Ensure that developers no longer need to switch between different IDEs.
* Provide enhanced language support, delivering an equally great experience in both Kotlin and Swift.
* Create a unified workflow that helps developers with experience in either iOS or Android to feel productive when working with both platforms.

We are also exploring new areas to enhance the development experience:

* Investigating building iOS apps using cloud machines to help developers who don't have convenient access to Apple devices.
* Experimenting with deeper AI tools integration to assist not only in code generation but also in more complex development tasks.

## Kotlin-to-Swift export

Our goal for 2025 is to release the first public version of direct Kotlin-to-Swift export.
The initial release aims to provide a user experience comparable to the existing Objective-C export,
while overcoming the constraints of Objective-C.

This will enable broader support for Swift language and facilitate exporting APIs,
paving the way for future improvements to fully leverage Swift export.

## Library ecosystem

As the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem rapidly expands, ensuring the backward compatibility of libraries becomes crucial.
Here's what we plan to do:

* Improve the klib format to allow library creators to leverage their knowledge of building JVM libraries.
* Implement the same code-inlining behavior in Kotlin Multiplatform libraries as for the JVM.
* Provide a tool that ensures your multiplatform library public API remains backward compatible.

We’re also looking to improve the publishing process for Kotlin Multiplatform libraries. We want to:

* Provide templates and comprehensive guidelines for creating and publishing KMP libraries.
* Stabilize klib cross-compilation on different platforms.
* Launch a fully re-designed KMP library publication process.
* Significantly improve the libraries' documentation process.

While Kotlin Multiplatform will receive significant updates, libraries build with the current format will still work
with newer Kotlin versions.

### Improving search for multiplatform libraries

There are now more than 2500 Kotlin Multiplatform libraries available.
However, despite the extensive selection, it can be challenging for developers to find libraries that meet their specific
needs and support their chosen platforms.

Our goal is to introduce a solution that facilitates the discovery of these libraries and allows developers to try them out easily.

### Amper

Amper is an experimental project configuration and build tool by JetBrains. In 2025, we will focus on making Amper fully
suitable for multiplatform mobile app development for Android and iOS, with shared Compose Multiplatform UI.

We aim to support:

* Running and testing applications locally, on physical devices, and within CI.
* Signing applications and publishing them in the Play Store and App Store.
* IDE integration to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.

### Gradle and other build tools

As we look ahead to 2025, our work on Gradle enhancements is outlined in the [Kotlin roadmap](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/roadmap.html#tooling).

Here are the key areas we will be working on regarding Kotlin Multiplatform in particular:

* Support declaring Kotlin Multiplatform dependencies at the project level. This will make it easier for developers
    to manage their project dependencies effectively.
* Improve integration of the Kotlin/Native toolchain into Gradle.
* Implement the next-generation distribution format for multiplatform libraries.
    This will simplify the dependencies model and publication layout for multiplatform libraries, making them easier
    to use with third-party build tools and reducing complexity for library authors.
* Provide full support for Kotlin Multiplatform in Declarative Gradle.
    Our work on the Experimental Kotlin Ecosystem Plugin, which supports Declarative Gradle, aims to help developers
    explore a declarative approach to their Gradle builds.

> * This roadmap is not an exhaustive list of all things the team is working on, only the biggest projects.
> * There's no commitment to delivering specific features or fixes in specific versions.
> * We will adjust our priorities as we go and update the roadmap accordingly.

## FAQ

### Why a standalone KMP IDE based on JetBrains Fleet and not just JetBrains Fleet?

Our goal is to provide an exceptional KMP development experience for a very broad audience,
including developers and teams without prior Kotlin experience who are considering their cross-platform development options.
For these users, easy onboarding to the KMP technology and intuitive tooling are crucial.

We want to offer an all-in-one tool that is tailored and optimized specifically for multiplatform development scenarios,
offers dedicated technology and tooling onboarding flows, and has a variety of relevant licensing options, including free ones.

Delivering the KMP tooling inside JetBrains Fleet was an interim solution that allowed us to get the tools in front of users more quickly.
We were able to embrace Fleet’s new approach as a generic multi-language code editor, gather feedback, and evaluate options along the way.

### Will the KMP IDE be free?

The KMP IDE will have a variety of free options.
The exact licensing and pricing schema will be announced at a later date.

### Will I now have to switch between not 4 but 5 IDEs?

No, our aim is quite the opposite – we want to reduce the number of IDEs you need to use.
The KMP IDE is designed to consolidate your development workflow, allowing you to perform most of your daily coding and
debugging tasks in one place.
While there might be occasional scenarios where another IDE is necessary, these cases should be rare.

### Can you fix KMP support in IntelliJ IDEA?

We recognize the importance of providing a great KMP experience in IntelliJ IDEA, and so we will continue to invest
in enhancing this support.
This will include improving quality and stability and introducing certain features so that developers who prefer
IntelliJ IDEA for multiplatform development aren’t required to leave their preferred IDE.

However, our ultimate goal is to provide a full-featured KMP experience in a dedicated KMP IDE for a broad audience.
This includes developers who are just considering cross-platform development options and don’t have experience
with IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio (or those who believe that these IDEs are only for backend and Android developers).

### What about KMP support in Android Studio?

We are actively collaborating with Google to improve KMP support in Android Studio.
More detailed plans will be available at a later date.
Stay tuned!

### Are you giving up on the web?

No, we're not giving up on the web at all!
We're actively working on Kotlin/Wasm support as well as on Compose Multiplatform for web to achieve feature parity
with other platforms.
Our current efforts include implementing drag-and-drop support, improving text input and rendering, and ensuring seamless
interoperability with HTML content.
We will share more detailed plans for the web soon. Stay tuned!

### What about Compose HTML?

While continuing to maintain the Compose HTML library by fixing bugs, we are also exploring use cases for it among existing users
so that we can formulate plans for its future development.
