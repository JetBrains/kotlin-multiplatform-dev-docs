The [Samples](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/multiplatform-samples.html) page aims to show robust and unique applications of Kotlin Multiplatform and is therefore heavily curated. Please, don't suggest edits to this page directly. To mark your project as an example of Kotlin Multiplatform applied, use the [kotlin-multiplatform-sample](https://github.com/topics/kotlin-multiplatform-sample) GitHub topic, and to show that your project is related to Kotlin Multiplatform in general, use the [kotlin-multiplatform](https://github.com/topics/kotlin-multiplatform) topic.

You can also [create a YouTrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=KT&c=Subsystems+Docs+%26+Examples) to discuss your suggestion with the Kotlin Technical Writing team.
